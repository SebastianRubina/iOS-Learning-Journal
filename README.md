# iOS Learning Journal
Welcome to my iOS Development Learning Journal! 

In here I will be documenting my step-by-step process to learning mobile development with Swift and SwiftUI!

## 100 Days of SwiftUI

After spending about a full day researching where to start, I ended up starting off with the **[100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)** course by Paul Hudson.

_Nov 6th - Nov 12th, 2022_

From these dates, I mostly went through days 1 to 15 on the course, which were an introduction to the Swift programming language. Thanks to my C and C++ courses from college, most of the topics were simple to understand how they worked, though I do feel that Swift uses some weird syntax!

Extensions were confusing and protocols were **definitely** confusing. I will most likely have to come back to these in the future.

Finally, after a long grind of running Swift on the console, I got to SwiftUI. Super excited! Learned the basic SwiftUI structure and moved on through days 16 to 18.

Topics learned include the following:
- Basic SwiftUI layout structure
- Introduction to Views
- Creating Forms
- `@State` _(are these like pointers?)_

I coded an app called **WeSplit** along the instructor, which calculates how much a bill should be split, including a tip percentage chosen by the user.

I started off with Day 19 of the course, which challenged us to make a similar app to what we had been building the day before, but to convert units. I chose length units.

I then moved on with day 20, in which I learned the following:
- Using stacks (`HStack`, `VStack`, `ZStack`)
- Adding colors, gradients
- Applying frames to elements and resizing them
- Buttons and Images (and Labels!)
- Showing alert messages

Mondays are super busy with class and homework, so started a bit late! Only managed to get through days 21 and 22 of the course.

It was pretty much a codealong to build a "Guess the Flag" game with a few challenges for us at the end. Didn't learn anything new, but strengthened my knowledge of previous subjects. This lesson helped me get a bit more comfortable with building a nice layout.

Definitely very different from building layouts for web. I'm not sure whether I prefer one or the other yet, as I am still only starting to learn SwiftUI, but similarities between both ways are near to none.

Had to take a couple of days off due to homework, but I'm back. Today I managed to get through days 23, 24 and 25.

Days 23 and 24 mostly taught me about how Views and Modifiers work behind the scenes, why we use the keyword `some` on `some View`, and how to create custom modifiers of my own. There was no project on these 2 days. 

Day 25 was a whole different story, I had to build an app from scratch. I really enjoyed this one, I basically had to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors app but with a twist. You get the Computer's pick and also what your goal for that turn is (to win or to lose), and based on that you make a move. 

I had lots of fun doing this one and designing it. I have never been good at the design side of things, but I believe that with time and practice I will start to get better at it.

_Nov 23rd - 24th, 2022_

Finished days 26, 27, and 28. Mainly focused on the following topics:
- Using CoreML to make predictions with Machine Learning based on data imported on from a .csv file
- Working with dates

The project we worked on was an app called BetterRest, that based on a user's on a desired wakeup time, desired amount of sleep, and daily cups of coffee intake, would predict an approximate time at which they should wake up.

Found CoreML really simple to use, Apple's drag and drop implementation makes it nice and a breeze to use in your apps, though it had me wondering if it was this easy in the real world or just in this specific example?

The app originally had a `calculate` button up top and would show an alert, but as a challenge, had to change it so there was no button and it would automatically update in real time as the user made changes in the form, and also instead of showing an alert every time, a big text would just show the time.
