# iOS Learning Journal
Welcome to my iOS Development Learning Journal! 

In here I will be documenting my step-by-step process to learning mobile development with Swift and SwiftUI!

## 100 Days of SwiftUI

After spending about a full day researching where to start, I ended up starting off with the **[100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)** course by Paul Hudson.

_Nov 6th - Nov 12th, 2022_

From these dates, I mostly went through days 1 to 15 on the course, which were an introduction to the Swift programming language. Thanks to my C and C++ courses from college, most of the topics were simple to understand how they worked, though I do feel that Swift uses some weird syntax!

Extensions were confusing and protocols were **definitely** confusing. I will most likely have to come back to these in the future.

Finally, after a long grind of running Swift on the console, I got to SwiftUI. Super excited! Learned the basic SwiftUI structure and moved on through days 16 to 18.

Topics learned include the following:
- Basic SwiftUI layout structure
- Introduction to Views
- Creating Forms
- `@State` _(are these like pointers?)_

I coded an app called **WeSplit** along the instructor, which calculates how much a bill should be split, including a tip percentage chosen by the user.

I started off with Day 19 of the course, which challenged us to make a similar app to what we had been building the day before, but to convert units. I chose length units.

I then moved on with day 20, in which I learned the following:
- Using stacks (`HStack`, `VStack`, `ZStack`)
- Adding colors, gradients
- Applying frames to elements and resizing them
- Buttons and Images (and Labels!)
- Showing alert messages
